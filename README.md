# mmail
Port of Python mail modules
This project is an attempt to port the python mail modules to some other language
by doing this I will learn a lot about a lot

So now I've just added test.txt and used the following commands:
$ git add test.txt
$ git commit test.txt
$ git push

$ git pull ; to get latest versions from repo
If multiple files are changed how is that handled
